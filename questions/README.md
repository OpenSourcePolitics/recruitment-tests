## What is an Object?

    Answer -> 
    An object is a class application ("instance") : the class would be the mold, and the object the cake. 
    OOP refers to a way of programming : we define boxes inside which we store properties (data) and methods (procedures). 
    By using classes and objects, code is better structured, and more malleable.

## [For Python developers] Can you name 5 python librairies that you used during your previous jobs (studies, personal or professional projects) and how they were useful? 

    Answer ->
    I must say that until now, I have never done a project in Python, but only a few exercises. 
    So the Python tests were a good way to go further in my knowledge, 
    and I am sure you are already familiar with the ones that I am going to list : 
    
    - enum : for Permissions and UserRole classes in an exercise of permissions distribution on a web site. 
    With enum, you easily set up a class by an enumaration of members; 
    - numPy : discovered for the level H of Python test. I need a way to do a for-each loop in the differents tuples; 
    - pytest : ... so well, you know !; 
    - re : to use RegEx; 
    - statistics : last time was for the climatologist exercise (level Y of Python test)

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer ->
    TESTING can't be a waste of money, regarding to : 
    - the time that you save when dev work on a project, 
    and check regularly that code works and does not generate regression, 
    - the quality that your customer deserves, 
    - the reputation earned by the company when you manage to deliver a free-bug product ! 
    But depending of planning and prioritization, it seems important to define "testing". 
    Sometimes, you may not need 100% coverage for example.
