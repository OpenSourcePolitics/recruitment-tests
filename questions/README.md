# Questions
**Instructions:** Answer the questions, be concise.

## What is an Object?

    Answer -> An object is a collection of data and methods. It contains methods that are used to manipulate the data and data that is stored in the object.

## [For Ruby developers] Can you explain the difference between include and extend in Ruby?

    Answer -> The include method adds the methods of the module to the object. The extend method adds the methods of the module to the class.

## [For Python developers] Can you name 5 python librairies that you used during your previous jobs (studies, personal or professional projects) and how they were useful? 

    Answer -> I used numPy to create arrays and matrices. I used pandas to create dataframes. I used matplotlib to create plots. I used BeautifulSoup to parse HTML. I used requests to make HTTP requests.

## A real estate developer has constructed a more than 100-storey building in the heart of Manhattan. Several months after the inauguration, residents complain about slow elevators, what can the real estate developer do to solve this problem?

    Answer -> The real estate developer could replace the elevators with a new elevator system that is more efficient, with less weight so that can go faster but have a restrained capacity that could be overcome by adding an other elevator next to it. But one more efficient way that plays with the user is to add a staircase next to the elevator. Obviously technically it wouldn't change anything, but the solution is not in the technical sense, but in the user experience. In one way it's obvious that user will still take the elevator but the complains will be less there for one reason. They will compare the elevator and the staircase and will return that the elevator is more efficient so it will seem 10 times faster than it was before. 

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer -> Firstly, we could say that it's a waste of time so a waste of money. But in fact it's not. Develop that are using test have a huge impact on the development process. It's not only the test that are used to check the code but also the code itself. If we don't have tests, it could be complicated to see any problem in a functionality, otherwise it permits to see some ways to optimize the code if two functionalities are similar. In a way that permits the developer to be "faster" in a way that is code will be more efficient and with less errors than if it wasn't tested.

## Set up a challenge for another candidate in order to test his/her abilities, explain your choice.

    Answer -> If I had to give a challenge for a candidate it would be a mix between logic and code. Not a hard technical challenge because to me it's not relevant of what a developer can really do, but it's a challenge that will be done in a way that will be interesting for the candidate, to make him think of the best solution, with the liberty to make a code optimized or not, but that can do the job. And obviouly at the end reward him if the solution is good, appliable in every case, and that code is not only good but also efficient.
