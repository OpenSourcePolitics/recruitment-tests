## A real estate developer has constructed a more than 100-storey building in the heart of Manhattan. Several months after the inauguration, residents complain about slow elevators, what can the real estate developer do to solve this problem?

    Answer -> Let's suppose we can't change the elevator itself and that there is many of them. We will then work on the resident's experience: How fast will he reach his floor.

    1st solution: Allocate half of the elevators to the odd floors, and the other half to the even floors. Average speed will then increase.

    2nd solution: Make sure that there is at least one of the elevators which is ready to go on the 1st floor. One or at least two if the first solution is activated.

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer -> On my own, not testing IS wasting money. However too much test can also be a waste of money. You have to find the right balance between too much and too little.
 
## Set up a challenge for another candidate in order to test his/her abilities, explain your choice.
   
    Answer -> I would ask to create a calendar representing days of month using only two six-sided dice. You have to be able to represent them from 01 to 31. 
    
    The idea is to see how the candidate will try to solve a mathematically impossible problem which is possible to solve in real life.
