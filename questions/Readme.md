## What is an Object? 

    Answer -> Used in several languages (C, C++, Python...), an object is something usable and manageable in a program refering to a specific context. It can be for example a function or a class. 

## Can you explain the difference between include and extend in Ruby?

    Answer -> To compare with Python language, "include" allows you to import the whole module that you need to use and, in the other side, "extend" allows you to target a part of code of this module but without import the whole module, like the "import (module)" and the "from (module) import (function)" in Python language.   

## A real estate developer has constructed a more than 100-storey building in the heart of Manhattan. Several months after the inauguration, residents complain about slow elevators, what can the real estate developer do to solve this problem?

    Answer -> Instead of set elevators able to cover each storey, split elevator by storey section (elevator 1 : floor 1 to 19, elevator 2 : floor 20 to 39...) will reduce travel time and allow residents to access their floor faster.  

## Is testing a waste of money? Why?

    Answer -> I don't think that testing is a waste of money because testing allows us to raise problems and things to improve and/or correct before going into production, so it's a major part to consider but, testing can be a waste of money if this one is not efficient and relevant.
